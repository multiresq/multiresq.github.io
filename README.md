### Abstract

>Today, more than 85% of Internet traffic has a multimedia com-ponent. Video streaming occupies a large part of this percentagemainly due to this type of content is provided by the most usedapplications on the Internet (e.g. Twitch, TikTok, Disney+, YouTube,Netflix, etc.). Most of these platforms use HTTP Adaptive Streaming(HAS) to send this media content to end users in order to ensure agood quality of experience (QoE). But, this QoE should be guaran-teed from the video to be transmitted, i.e., the video should havean adequate quality by minimizing the bitrate before transmission. In order to solve this issue, we present a system capable of en-coding a video in several resolutions given the desired value ofan objective metric. Our system includes the objective metric inthe encoding loop in order to maintain the quality in all segments.This system has been tested with three video and five resolutionsfor each video. Our proposal provides improvements of more than10% in terms of video size and with similar coding times whencompared with a constant CRF encoding.
